Create a virtual environment. 

Install all of the required packages using:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Edit the Configuration file (or add your own) in the ```configs/``` directory.
Let ```cfg``` be the Configuration file. Depending on your desired experiment, change the ```cfg['data']['dataset']``` value to one of 
```
DNA_Aug
DNA_GaussianAug
DNA_NES_Aug
DNA_NES_NoAug
DNA_NoAug
```
Determine whether or not you would like to load a pretrained model. To load a pretrained model, place the model file in the ```pretrained/```
folder and set the ```cfg["training"]["pretrained"] = True```.  Otherwise, set ```cfg["training"]["pretrained"] = False```.

1) To train the model, on a SLURM compute node, execute:

```sbatch train.py```

The ```slurm/``` folder will contain a standard output and standard error file associated with your experiment. 

2) To train the model in a conventional Python environment, execute: 

```python -u train.py --config configs/psp_segmenter.yml```

You may generate and use your own Configuration file, if desired.

The ```runs/``` directory will automatically populate with an experiment folder that has the same name as the Configuration file and 
contain a dedicated folder with a uniquely generated run_id.

To test a desired model after training is complete, the model path and the dataset will need to be specified.
Note, the test dataset must match the dataset type used for training. 

That is, training on 

```DNA_Aug, DNA_GaussianAug, DNA_NoAug``` requires testing using ```DNA_test``` 

and training on

```DNA_NES_Aug, DNA_NES_NoAug``` requires testing using ```DNA_NES_test```

For example, to test the model associated with experiment run 9999 on dataset without augmentations (e.g. DNA_test), execute:

```python -u test_pspnet.py --model_path "runs/psp_segmenter/9999/pspnet_segmenter_best_model.pkl" --dataset "DNA_test" ```

A SLURM sbatch script called ```test.sh``` has also been included for convenience.
