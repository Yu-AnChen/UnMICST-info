The clustering result reveals a very small population of `E-cadherin` (green) and `CD45` (purple) double positive cells. Such a cell type currently does not exist; the very low abundance indicates accurate segmentation. Further inspection shows these to be T-cells tightly associated between epithelial cells, a known phenomenon. Therefore, future improvements in segmentation will also need to take into consideration of such rare but biologically significant spatial arrangements.\n\nUMAP colored by clustering result ![UMAP by cluster](../images/umap-clustering.png)\n\nand by integrated intensities of CD45 and E-cadherin in each segments ![UMAP by markers](../images/umap-markers.png)",
